**Weather Forecasting System**

Project Overview This project develops a machine learning model to predict rainfall probability over the next 21 days using historical weather data. It consists of two main components:
Machine Learning Model Development: Data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training, and optimization.
MLOps System Design: System architecture for real-time weather forecasting using IoT data.
Problem Statement Farmers require precise weather forecasts for effective agricultural planning. Traditional forecasts lack hyper-local accuracy. This project leverages machine learning to enhance rainfall predictions and integrates real-time IoT data processing.
Dataset The dataset contains 300 days of daily weather observations:
Average Temperature (Â°C)
Humidity (%)
Average Wind Speed (km/h)
Rain or Not (1 = rain, 0 = no rain)
Date

**Objectives**

**Part 1: Machine Learning Model Development**

Data Preprocessing 
Handle missing values
Encode features
Fix formatting issues
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
Analyze feature correlations with rainfall
Visualize trends and patterns
Model Training and Evaluation 
Train models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting)
Compare performance metrics
Hyperparameter Tuning & Feature Engineering 
Optimize model parameters
Select key features
Prediction Output 
Generate rain probability predictions

**Part 2: MLOps System Design**

As an MLOps Engineer, design a system that processes real-time IoT data to predict daily rainfall probability for 21 days. The system should:
Handle 1-minute interval data streams from IoT devices
Detect and manage sensor inconsistencies
Expected Deliverables:
System Diagram: Visual representation of data flow from sensors to predictions
Component Descriptions: Explanation of each system element
Submission Requirements:
Jupyter Notebook: Includes code for data processing, analysis, model training, and evaluation.
